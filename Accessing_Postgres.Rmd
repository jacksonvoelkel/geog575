# The Postgres Server

# Where is it?

##

The server we will be using is located at: <br> learn-pgsql.rc.pdx.edu.

Did you look it up in your browser? Nothing is there! What's the deal?

<script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.2.1/jquery.min.js"></script>

<style>
    .reveal section img { background:none; border:none; box-shadow:none; }
</style>


# What is it?

##

Think of that previous link as your access point to the class's Postgres databases (reffered to as the 'host').

learn-pgsql.rc.pdx.edu is a server, but unlike those displaying this presentation it does not contain a website - it's the computer that our Postgres database lives on.

# How do I access it?

##

We can plug this into PgAdmin to begin connecting to our databases. We'll give it an easy-to-identify name too...

##

<small>Note: your PgAdmin may look different - this is purely cosmetic.</small>

##

I've sent you all your login information, which you put in the same connection window.

<b>Note: </b> be careful saving passwords on lab computers! 

##

##

Once connected, we can find our tables in:

Databases > username > Schemas > public

##

##

The passwords are long and complex, which makes them hard to remember. Also, because I sent these to you over the internet, please reset it!

Under our class's server in PgAdmin, navigate to "Login Roles". From this, right click your name, select "Properties", navigate to "Definition", enter your new password twice, and hit ok!

<small><b>WARNING!</b> Do NOT forget this new password!</small>

##

Seriously, do NOT forget your new password.

# What do I do now?

##

To start querying the tables, hit the 'SQL' magnifying glass button in PgAdmin. This will open a new window that allows you to write code and run queries!

# More resources

##

There are two videos on D2L from the course's previous instructor detailing the use of PgAdmin 3 - please watch them!

If you do not have access to D2L (<i>and</i> are registered for the course!) please contact me via Slack.

##

Finall, happy querying!
