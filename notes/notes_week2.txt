1. Either!!! Null is NOTHING, not 0!
2. No! 

SELECT AVG(prod_price)
FRom products
GROUP BY vend_id;

3. TRUE... some aggregation must happen!
4. Month/Day/Year vs. Day/Month/Year
5. 
	a) Doesn't work! COUNT() will just return a single number.. either remove count or remove prod_price
	b) Works fine!

7. 30000.00	SELECT AVG(salary) FROM employee_pay;
8. 2000.00	SELECT MAX(bonus) FROM employee_pay;
9. 90000.00	SELECT SUM(salary) FROM employee_pay;
10. 11.00	SELECT MIN(pay_rate) FROM employee_pay;
11. 6	 SELECT COUNT(*) FROM employee_pay;
12. No duplicates, instead shows a count of how many times that city occurs.
13.  
	SELECT city, count(*) FROM employees
	GROUP BY city
	HAVING count(*) > 1;
14. 
	SELECT city, count(*) FROM employees
        GROUP BY city
	ORDER BY 2 DESC;
--OR
	SELECT city, count(*) FROM employees
        GROUP BY city
	ORDER BY count(*) DESC;

15. 
	SELECT position
		,AVG(salary) avg_salary

16.
	SELECT position

17. -- some people may miss the LOWER() function! Also, they might miss to give it an alias (in the instructions!)

	SELECT (LOWER(first_name) || '.'  || LOWER(last_name) || '@example.com') emails
	FROM employees;

18. -- Some people will miss "INITCAP"... good time to drive home that google rules. ctrl+f 'first'. select initcap('thIs funCtiON iS suPER hELPful!');

	SELECT
	INITCAP(LOWER(last_name)) || ', ' || INITCAP(LOWER(first_name)) emp_name,

19. -- hinges on them finding TO_CHAR!
	SELECT emp_id
		,INITCAP(TO_CHAR(date_hire,'day')) hire_dat
